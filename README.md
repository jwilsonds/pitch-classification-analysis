# pitch-classification-analysis
This repository contains all the code for my MLB pitch classification analysis that I posted on Medium
The file 'Paddack and Verlander Classification' contains the code I used to test out the model and get the release point plot for Verlander
The file 'Sean Manaea Classification' contains the code I used to test the model and get his release point plot
The file 'Pitch Classification Model' contains the function I created to run the actual model and the code for calculating the precision scores for 16 MLB players
